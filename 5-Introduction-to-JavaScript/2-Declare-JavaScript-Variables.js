// Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
