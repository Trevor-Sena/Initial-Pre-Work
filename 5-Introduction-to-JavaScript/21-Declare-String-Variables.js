// "your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

var myFirstName = "First Name";
var myLastName = "Last Name";
