// Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. You can use escaped on characters you might not otherwise be able to type out or to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.

var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";
