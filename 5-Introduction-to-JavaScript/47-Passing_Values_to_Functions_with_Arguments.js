// When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are passed into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

// Example
function ourFunctionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a - b);
}
ourFunctionWithArgs(10, 5); // Outputs 5

// Only change code below this line.

function functionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a+b);
}

functionWithArgs(4, 4);
