// Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way and you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Spot",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["none"]



};
