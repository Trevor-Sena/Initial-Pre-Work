// A "do...while" loop will "do" one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then it run "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.
do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++
}
while (i < 10);
